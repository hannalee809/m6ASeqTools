# m6AnetAnalyzer

**m6AnetAnalyzer** is an R package for downstream analysis of m6A predictions generated by m6Anet from Oxford Nanopore direct RNA sequencing data. It provides tools for quality control, transcript- and gene-level summarization, comparative methylation analysis across conditions, and integration with differential gene expression results.

The primary goal of m6ASeqTools is to make m6Anet output accessible to a broad range of users, including those without extensive programming experience, through a well-documented and reproducible analysis workflow.

Key features include:

- Quality control summaries of m6Anet site-level predictions
- Transcript region and biotype annotation of m6A sites
- Weighted modification ratio (WMR) calculation
- Differential methylation analysis with or without replicates
- Integration with DESeq2 differential gene expression results
- Export of genomic coordinates for IGV/UCSC visualization

## Installation

```r
# Install directly from GitHub

# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hannalee809/m6AnetAnalyzer", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Requires R ≥ 4.0. Available on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Input Requirements

m6ASeqTools is designed to work directly with m6Anet output and requires the following inputs:

- `data.site_proba.csv` generated by m6Anet (per-site m6A probabilities)

- A corresponding GTF annotation file (e.g., GENCODE or Ensembl)

- (Optional) Differential gene expression results (e.g., DESeq2 output)

The package was developed using RNA002 DRS datasets but is fully compatible with RNA004 data, as the m6Anet output format remains unchanged between versions.

## Typical Workflow

1. Load m6Anet per-site probability output and compute QC and summary statistics

2. Compute transcript-level WMRs

3. Perform comparative methylation analysis (with or without replicates)

4. (Optional) Integrate methylation results with gene expression and summarize transcript biotype and/or transcript region distributions

5. (Optional) Visualize and m6A sites on IGV and incorporate external BED annotations
