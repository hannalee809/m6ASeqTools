\title{Compute Wilcoxon Test (Mann-Whitney U test) for Differential Methylation}
\usage{
run_wmr_differential_test(
  condition1_list,
  condition2_list,
  condition1_name,
  condition2_name
)
}
\arguments{
\item{condition1_list}{A list of data frames for condition 1. Each must contain
\code{ensembl_transcript_id} and \code{weighted_mod_ratio}.}

\item{condition2_list}{A list of data frames for condition 2. Same required
columns as \code{condition1_list}.}

\item{condition1_name}{A string naming condition 1.}

\item{condition2_name}{A string naming condition 2.}
}
\value{
A tibble with one row per transcript containing:
\itemize{
\item \verb{m6A transcript info}
\item \verb{median weighted mod ratio for condition 1}
\item \verb{median weighted mod ratio for condition 2}
\item \code{median_diff} — median WMR( condition2 – condition1 )
\item \code{p_value} — Wilcoxon rank-sum test p-value
}
}
\description{
This function computes a statistical test for differential methylation for
conditions with replicates. Specifically, it performs a Wilcoxon rank-sum
test per transcript to compare weighted modification ratios (WMR) between the
two conditions.
}
\details{
Transcripts with all-zero WMR values across replicates are removed.
Transcripts without data in both conditions return \code{NA} for all outputs.
